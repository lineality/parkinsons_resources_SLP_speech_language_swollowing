	- reducing simplicity (count by 3 vs. count by 1)
	- adding intermediate steps (1, something, 2, something, 3, something; or count punch 
name object and color)
	- synchronized processes (count and punch and step)

## 2. breath control: 
	- taking a breath
	- speaking with lungs full (not breathing out first)
	- taking a breath initially
	- taking a breath in the middle of a task

## 3. duration (10 seconds is the average (median?) duration of a sentence)

## 5. focus-endurance (how many elements)

## 6. volume (70 decibel target)
